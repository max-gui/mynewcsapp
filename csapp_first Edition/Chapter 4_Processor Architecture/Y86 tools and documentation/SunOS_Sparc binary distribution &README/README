This directory contains the binary distribution of the Y86 tools for
SunOS/Sparc systems. It is designed for instructors and students who
are using the textbook, "Computer Systems: A Programmer's
Perspective", R. Bryant and D. O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall, 2002. 

The GUI libraries are statically linked into the binaries, so you
don't need to have Tcl/Tk installed on your system to run the
simulators. This is particularly handy if you just want to use the Y86
simulators for demonstration purposes.
